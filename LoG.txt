N'ayant pas grand chose a raconter, veuillez trouver ci-joint les paroles de Blacken The Cursed Sun par Lanb Of God :

Seize a darkened day,
There's only hell to pay,
And no one left to see this prodigal return.
Sweet apathy's my toll.
You'll mourn the traded soul.
I'll dig a deeper hole.
Sanctity, a breath away.
Just a breath away.
Blacken the cursed sun.
You're not the only one,
To have sunk so far and low.
There is no tomorrow.
A tragedy on display,
A sickness for all to see.
I will kill this part of myself that I hate and that I see in you.
It was always mine, anyway.
There's something you can't take away.
I choose not to feel the pain
Sanctity, a breath away.
Just a breath away.
Away.
Just a breath away.
Blacken the cursed sun.
You're not the only one,
To have sunk so far and low.
There is no tomorrow.
Blacken the cursed sun.
Blacken what's yet to be done.
Blacken, because now you know, there is no tomorrow.
Is there still hope for us?
Can we still be saved?
Does your God hold a place for us?
There is no tomorrow.
Is there still hope for us?
Can we still be saved?
Does your God hold a place for us?
Is there time to repent?
Will we rise from the dead?
Can these sins even be forgiven?
Is there still hope for us?
Were we ever even alive?
Is any of this even real?
You're just a breath away.
You're just a breath away.
Better to die quick fighting on your feet
Then to live forever begging on your knees
